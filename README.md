# Hi, I'm Loghman Samani! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate bioinformatician and computational biologist currently pursuing my master's degree in Technical Biology at the University of Stuttgart. Here, I explore the fascinating intersection of biology and technology, applying cutting-edge computational methods to unravel the mysteries of life.

## About Me

### Field of Interest
My primary focus is on **bioinformatics**, with a specialization in **protein bioinformatics**. I delve into various aspects of this field, including protein structure analysis, folding prediction, protein databases, evolutionary protein bioinformatics, and more.

### Computational Neuroscience
I'm also deeply intrigued by **computational neuroscience**, especially neural networks and deep learning. I love applying these techniques to various biological domains, seeking to understand the brain and its complexities.

### Systems Biology
Another area of expertise is **systems biology**, where I harness the power of machine learning and deep learning models to decipher complex biological systems. I'm passionate about using data-driven approaches to gain insights into the intricate workings of living organisms.

### Coding Skills
I have a strong background in coding, particularly in **Python**, and I'm well-versed in popular libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. I'm also familiar with **R**, **Matlab**, and **C++** (although at a basic level). These skills allow me to analyze and process data efficiently, a crucial aspect of my work in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## Collaboration

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on bioinformatics projects that leverage **machine learning methods** to tackle diverse biological problems. If you're working on such projects or have ideas you'd like to explore together, please don't hesitate to reach out! Let's combine our knowledge and expertise to make meaningful contributions to the world of biology.
