# Hi, I'm Loghman Samani! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate bioinformatician and computational biologist currently pursuing my master's degree in Technical Biology at the University of Stuttgart. Here, I explore the fascinating intersection of biology and technology, applying cutting-edge computational methods to unravel the mysteries of life.

## About Me

### Field of Interest
My primary focus is on **bioinformatics**, with a specialization in **protein bioinformatics**. I delve into various aspects of this field, including protein structure analysis, folding prediction, protein databases, evolutionary protein bioinformatics, and more.

### Computational Neuroscience
I'm also deeply intrigued by **computational neuroscience**, especially neural networks and deep learning. I love applying these techniques to various biological domains, seeking to understand the brain and its complexities.

### Systems Biology
Another area of expertise is **systems biology**, where I harness the power of machine learning and deep learning models to decipher complex biological systems. I'm passionate about using data-driven approaches to gain insights into the intricate workings of living organisms.

### Coding Skills
I have a strong background in coding, particularly in **Python**, and I'm well-versed in popular libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. I'm also familiar with **R**, **Matlab**, and **C++** (although at a basic level). These skills allow me to analyze and process data efficiently, a crucial aspect of my work in bioinformatics and computational biology.

## Collaboration

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on bioinformatics projects that leverage **machine learning methods** to tackle diverse biological problems.
